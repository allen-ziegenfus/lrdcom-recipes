	<div>
		We're looking for thought-provoking sessions that will help our attendees understand a cutting-edge concept or learn a new skill that will affect their business over the next 6 to 18 months. Help your proposal stand out in a good way by following the guidelines below:
	</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Provide a simple and direct title.</li>
		<li>
			Define your target audience. What are the topics and who are you trying to reach?</li>
		<li>
			Share a unique story. Any insights, lessons, and personal experiences are well received by your audience.</li>
		<li>
			Offer original and substantial content. Highlight the relevance of your topic.</li>
		<li>
			Provide a clear and concise description of what attendees will learn.</li>
		<li>
			Focus on experiences and insight instead of product or service benefits. Sales pitches will be rejected.</li>
		<li>
